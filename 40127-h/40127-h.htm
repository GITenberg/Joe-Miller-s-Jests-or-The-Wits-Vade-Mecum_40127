being behind the Scenes the First Night of the <i>Beggar's Opera</i>,
and meeting <i>Cibber</i> there, well <i>Colley</i>, said he, how d'you
like the <i>Beggar's Opera</i>? Why it makes one laugh, my Lord,
answer'd he, on the Stage; but how will it do in print. O! very well,
I'll answer for it, said the Duke, if you don't write a Preface to
it.<a href="#note1" name="noteref1" class="fnanchor"><small>[1]</small></a>
</p>

<p class="indent">
  2. There being a very great Disturbance one Evening at <i>Drury-Lane</i>
Play-House, Mr. <i>Wilks</i>, coming upon the Stage to say something to
pacify the Audience, had an Orange thrown full at him, which he having
took up, making a low Bow, this is no <i>Civil Orange</i>, I think, said
he.
</p>

<p class="indent">
  3. Mr. <i>H&mdash;rr&mdash;n</i>, one of the Commissioners of the Revenue in
<i>Ireland</i>, being one Night in the Pit, at the Play-House in
<i>Dublin</i>, <i>Monoca Gall</i>, the Orange Girl, famous for her Wit
and her Assurance, striding over his Back, he popp'd his Hands under her
Petticoats: Nay, Mr. Commissioner, said she, you'll find no Goods there
but what have been fairly entered.
</p>

<p class="indent">
  4. <i>Joe Miller</i> sitting one day in the Window at the
<i>Sun-Tavern</i> in <i>Clare-Street</i>, a Fish Woman and her Maid
passing by, the Woman cry'd, <i>Buy my Soals; buy my Maids</i>: Ah, you
wicked old Creature, cry'd honest <i>Joe</i>, <i>What are you not
content to sell your own Soul, but you must sell your Maid's too?</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
  5. When the Duke of <i>Ormond</i> was young, and came first to Court, he
happen'd to stand next my Lady <i>Dorchester</i>, one Evening in the
Drawing-Room, who being but little upon the Reserve on most Occasions,
let a Fart, upon which he look'd her full in the Face and laugh'd.
What's the Matter, my Lord, said she: Oh! I heard it, Madam, reply'd the
Duke, you'll make a fine Courtier indeed, said she, if you mind every
Thing you <i>hear</i> in this Place.
</p>

<p class="indent">
  6. A poor Man, who had a termagant Wife, after a long Dispute, in which
she was resolved to have the last Word, told her, if she spoke one more
<i>crooked</i> Word, he'd beat her Brains out: Why then <i>Ram's
Horns</i>, you Rogue, said she, if I die for't.
</p>

<p class="indent">
  7. A Gentleman ask'd a Lady at <i>Tunbridge</i>, who had made a very
large Acquaintance among the Beaus and pretty Fellows there, what she
would do with them all. O! said she, they pass off like the Waters; and
pray, Madam, reply'd the Gentleman do they all <i>pass</i> the <i>same
Way</i>?
</p>

<p class="indent">
  8. An Hackney-Coachman, who was just set up, had heard that the Lawyers
used to club their <i>Three-Pence</i> a-piece, four of them, to go to
<i>Westminster</i>, and being called by a Lawyer at <i>Temple-Bar</i>,
who, with two others in their Gowns, got into his Coach, he was bid to
drive to <i>Westminster-Hall</i>: but the Coachman still holding his
Door open, as if he waited for more Company; one of the Gentlemen asked
him, why he did not shut the Door and go on, the Fellow, scratching his
Head, cry'd you know, Master, my Fare's a Shilling, I can't go for
<i>Nine-Pence</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
  9. Two Free-thinking Authors proposed to a Bookseller, that was a little
decayed in the World, that if he would print their Works they would
<i>set him up</i>, and indeed they were as good as their Word, for in
six Week's Time he was in the <i>Pillory</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 10. A Gentleman was saying one Day at the <i>Tilt-Yard</i> Coffee-House,
when it rained exceeding hard, that it put him in Mind of the General
<i>Deluge</i>; Zoons, Sir, said an old Campaigner, who stood by, who's
that? I have heard of all the <i>Generals</i> in <i>Europe</i> but him.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 11. A certain Poet and Player, remarkable for his Impudence and
Cowardice, happening many Years ago to have a Quarrel with Mr.
<i>Powell</i>, another Player, received from him a smart Box of the Ear;
a few Days after the Poetical Player having lost his Snuff-Box, and
making strict Enquiry if any Body had seen his <i>Box</i>; what said
another of the Buskin'd Wits, <i>that</i> which <i>George Powell</i>
gave you t'other Night?
</p>

<p class="indent">
 12. <i>Gun Jones</i>, who had made his Fortune himself from a mean
Beginning, happening to have some Words with a Person who had known him
some Time, was asked by the other, how he could have the Impudence to
give himself so many Airs to him, when he knew very well, that he
remember'd him seven Years before with hardly a <i>Rag to his A&mdash;</i>.
You lie, Sirrah, reply'd <i>Jones</i>, seven Years ago <i>I had nothing
but Rags to my A&mdash;</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 13. Lord <i>R&mdash;&mdash;</i> having lost about fifty Pistoles, one Night, at
the Gaming-Table in <i>Dublin</i>, some Friends condoling with him upon
his ill Luck, Faith, said he, I am very well pleas'd at what I have
done, for I have bit them, by G&mdash;&mdash; there is not one Pistole that don't
want Six-Pence of Weight.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 14. Mother <i>Needham</i>, about 25 Years age being much in Arrear with
her Landlord for Rent, was warmly press'd by him for his Money, Dear
Sir, said she, how can you be so pressing at this dead Time of the Year,
in about six Weeks Time both the Par&mdash;&mdash;, and the C&mdash;n&mdash;v&mdash;c&mdash;n will
sit, and then Business will be so brisk, that I shall be able to pay ten
Times the Sum.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 15. A Lady being asked how she liked a Gentleman's Singing, who had a
very <i>stinking Breath</i>, the Words are good, said she, but the
<i>Air</i> is intolerable.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 16. The late Mrs. <i>Oldfield</i> being asked if she thought Sir <i>W.
Y.</i> and Mrs. <i>H&mdash;&mdash;n</i>, who had both stinking Breaths, were
marry'd: I don't know, said she, whether they are marry'd; but I am sure
there is a <i>Wedding</i> between them.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 17. A Gentleman saying something in Praise of Mrs. <i>G&mdash;&mdash;ve</i>, who
is, without Dispute, a good Player, tho' exceeding saucy and exceeding
ugly; another said, her Face always put him in mind of <i>Mary-Bone
Park</i>, being desired to explain himself, he said, it was vastly
<i>rude</i> and had not one Bit of <i>Pale</i> about it.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 18. A pragmatical young Fellow sitting at Table over-against the learned
<i>John Scot</i>, asked him what difference there was between
<i>Scot</i> and <i>Sot</i>: <i>Just the Breadth of the Table</i>,
answered the other.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 19. Another Poet asked <i>Nat Lee</i> if it was not easy to write like a
<i>Madman</i>, as he did: No, answered <i>Nat</i>, but it is easy to
write like a <i>Fool</i> as you do.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 20. <i>Colley</i>, who, notwithstanding his <i>Odes</i>, has now and
then said a good Thing, being told one Night by the late Duke of
<i>Wharton</i>, that he expected to see him <i>hang'd</i> or
<i>beggar'd</i> very soon, by G&mdash;d, said the Laureat, if I had your
Grace's <i>Politicks</i> and <i>Morals</i> you might expect <i>both</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 21. Sir <i>Thomas More</i>, for a long Time had only Daughters, his Wife
earnestly praying that they may have a Boy, at last they had a
<i>Boy</i>, who when he came to Man's Estate, proved but simple; <i>thou
prayedst so long for a Boy</i>, said Sir <i>Thomas</i> to his Wife,
<i>that at last thou hast got one who will be a Boy as long as he
lives</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 22. The same Gentleman, when Lord Chancellor being pressed by the
Counsel of the Party, for a <i>longer day</i> to perform a Decree, said,

</p>

<p class="indent">
 23. This famous Chancellor, who preserved his Humour and his Wit to the
last Moment, when he came to be executed on <i>Tower-Hill</i>, the

he, taking off his <i>Cap</i>, That I think is my <i>Upper-Garment</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 24. The Great <i>Algernoon Sidney</i> seemed to shew as little Concern
at his Death, he had indeed got some Friends to intercede with the King
for a Pardon; but when he was told, that his Majesty could not be
prevailed upon to give him his Life, but that in Regard to his ancient
and noble Family, he would remit Part of his Sentence, and only have his
Head cut off; nay, said he, if his Majesty is resolved to have my
<i>Head</i> he may make a Whistle of my <i>A&mdash;&mdash;</i> if he pleases.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 25. Lady <i>C&mdash;&mdash;g</i> and her two Daughters having taken Lodgings at a
Leather-Breeches Maker's in <i>Piccadilly</i>, the Sign of the
<i>Cock</i> and <i>Leather-Breeches</i>, was always put to the Blush
when she was obliged to give any Body Direction to her Lodgings, the
Sign being so odd a one; upon which my Lady, a very good Sort of Woman,
sending for her Landlord, a jolly young Fellow, told him, she liked him
and his Lodgings very well, but she must be obliged to quit them on
Account of his Sign, for she was ashamed to tell any body what it was,
O! dear Madam, said the young Fellow, I would do any Thing rather than
lose so good Lodgers, I can easily alter my Sign; so I think, answered
my Lady, and I'll tell you how you may satisfy both me and my Daughters:
<i>Only take down your</i> Breeches <i>and let your</i> Cock
<i>stand</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 26. When <i>Rablais</i> the greatest Drole in <i>France</i>, lay on his
Death-Bed, he could not help jesting at the very last Moment, for having

<p class="indent">
 29. When Sir <i>Richard Steele</i> was fitting up his great Room, in
<i>York-Buildings</i>, for publick Orations, that very Room, which is
now so worthily occupied by the learned and eximious Mr. Professor
<i>Lacy</i>. He happened at one Time to be pretty much behind Hand with
his Workmen, and coming one Day among them to see how they went forward,
he ordered one of them to get into the <i>Rostrum</i>, and make a
Speech, that he might observe how it could be heard, the Fellow
mounting, and scratching his Pate, told him he knew not what to say, for
in Truth he was no Orator. Oh! said the Knight, no Matter for that,
speak any thing that comes uppermost. Why here, Sir <i>Richard</i>, said
the Fellow, we have been working for you these six Weeks, and cannot get
one Penny of Money, pray, Sir, when do you design to pay us? Very well,
very well, said Sir <i>Richard</i>, pray come down, I have heard enough,
I cannot but own you speak very distinctly, tho' I don't admire your
Subject.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 30. A Country Clergyman meeting a Neighbour who never came to Church,
altho' an old Fellow of above Sixty, he gave him some Reproof on that
Account, and asked him if he never read at Home: No, replyed the Clown,
I can't read; I dare say, said the Parson you don't know who made you;
not I, in troth, said the Countryman. A little Boy coming by at the same
Time, who made you, Child, cry'd the Parson, <i>God</i>, Sir, answered
the Boy. Why look you there, quoth the honest Clergyman, are not you
ashamed to hear a Child of five or six Years old tell me who made him,
when you that are so old a Man can not: Ah, said the Countryman, it is
no Wonder that he should remember, he was made but t'other Day, it is a
great while, Master, sin I were made.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 31. A certain reverend Drone in the Country was complaining to another,
that it was a great Fatigue to preach twice a Day. Oh! said the other, I

<p class="indent">
 32. One of the foresaid Gentlemen, as was his Custom, preaching most
exceedingly dull to a Congregation not used to him, many of them slunk
out of the Church one after another, before the Sermon was near ended.
Truly, said a Gentleman present, this learned Doctor has made a very
<i>moving</i> Discourse.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 33. Sir <i>William Davenant</i>, the Poet, had <i>no Nose</i>, who going
along the Meuse one Day, a Beggar-Woman followed him, crying, ah! God
preserve your <i>Eye-Sight</i>; Sir, the Lord preserve your
<i>Eye-Sight</i>. Why, good Woman, said he, do you pray so much for my
<i>Eye-Sight</i>? Ah! dear Sir, answered the Woman, if it should please
God that you grow dim-sighted, you have no Place to hang your
<i>Spectacles</i> on.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 34. A Welchman bragging of his Family, said, his Father's Effigies was
set up in <i>Westminster-Abbey</i>, being ask'd whereabouts, he said in
the same Monument with Squire <i>Thyne</i>'s for he was his Coachman.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 35. A Person was saying, not at all to the Purpose, that really
<i>Sampson</i>, was a very strong Man; Ay, said another, but you are
much stronger, for you make nothing of lugging him by the Head and
Shoulders.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 36. My Lord <i>Strangford</i>, who stammered very much, was telling a
certain Bishop that sat at his Table, that <i>Balaam</i>'s Ass spoke
because he was Pri&mdash;&mdash;est&mdash;&mdash; Priest-rid, Sir, said a Valet-de-Chambre,
who stood behind his Chair, my Lord would say. No, Friend, reply'd the
Bishop, <i>Balaam</i> could not speak himself, and so his <i>Ass</i>
spoke for him.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 37. The same noble Lord ask'd a Clergy-man once, at the Bottom of his
Table, why the <i>Goose</i>, if there was one, was always plac'd next
the <i>Parson</i>. Really, said he, I can give no Reason for it; but
your Question is so odd, that I shall never see a <i>Goose</i> for the
future without thinking of your <i>Lordship</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 38. A Gentleman was asking another how that poor Devil <i>S&mdash;&mdash;ge</i>
could live, now my Lord <i>T&mdash;&mdash;l</i> had turn'd him off. Upon his Wits
said the other; <i>That is living upon a slender Stock indeed</i>,
reply'd the First.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 39. A Country Parson having divided his Text under two and twenty Heads,
one of the Congregation went out of the Church in a great Hurry, and
being met by a Friend, he ask'd him, whither he was going? <i>Home for
my Night-Cap</i>, answered the first, <i>For I find we are to stay here
all Night</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 40. A very modest young Gentleman, of the County of <i>Tiperary</i>,
having attempted many Ways in vain, to acquire the Affections of a Lady
of great Fortune, at last try'd what was to be done, by the Help of
Musick, and therefore entertained her with a Serenade under her Window,
at Midnight, but she ordered her Servants to drive him thence by
throwing <i>Stones</i> at him; <i>Your Musick, my Friend</i>, said one
of his Companions, is as powerful as that of <i>Orpheus</i>, for it
draws the very <i>Stones about you</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 41. A certain Senator, who is not, it may be, esteemed the wisest Man in
the House, has a frequent Custom of shaking his Head when another
speaks, which giving Offence to a particular Person, he complained of
the Affront; but one who had been long acquainted with him, assured the
House, it was only an ill Habit he had got, for though he would
oftentimes shake his <i>Head</i>, there was <i>nothing</i> in it.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 42. A Gentleman having lent a Guinea, for two or three Days, to a Person
whose Promises he had not much Faith in, was very much surpriz'd to find
he very punctually kept his Word with him; the same Gentleman being
sometime after desirous of borrowing the like Sum, No, said the other,
you have <i>deceived</i> me once, and I am resolved you shan't do it a
second Time.
</p>

<p class="indent">
 43. My Lord Chief Justice Holt had sent, by his Warrant, one of the
<i>French Prophets</i>, a foolish Sect, that started up in his Time, to
Prison; upon which Mr. <i>Lacy</i>, one of their Followers, came one Day

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
